You can find more information about Apper on it's website:
http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Apper?content=84745

Unfortunately, is it not possible to create a watch file, because the
Apper source-code location cannot be scanned. (It uses DropBox)
Instead, use the kde-apps.org page to get new Apper versions.
